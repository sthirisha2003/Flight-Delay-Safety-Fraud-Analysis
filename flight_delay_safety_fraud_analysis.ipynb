# Flight Delay, Safety & Fraud Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airline operational data to identify delay patterns, safety insights, and potential fraudulent activities using data analytics and machine learning models.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Objectives
- Analyze flight delay trends
- Identify safety risk indicators
- Detect fraudulent patterns using classification models

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Insights & Visualization

## Results
- Achieved ~84% model accuracy
- Identified delay-prone routes and peak delay hours
- Flagged suspicious flight records via anomaly detection
